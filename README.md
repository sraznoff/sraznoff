I am a 10 year GIS Professional who is making the transition to software engineering.  I have a lot of history scripting with python and sql is second nature but i am looking to really get in and make a contribution on some big sophisticated software projects.  Bootcamp Fall 2022 focusing on backend using java and springboot, but i have also dabbled with .NET too.  
In my personal time I am a serial hobbyist.  Right now i have been working on some car stuff but recently i got into ebikes and woodworking. I am always on the lookout for my next project.
